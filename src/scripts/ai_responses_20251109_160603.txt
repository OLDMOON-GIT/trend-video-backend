I understand you need a product video script in JSON format. However, I notice the document contains placeholders for product information that need to be filled in:

{thumbnail}
{product_link}
{product_description}

Could you provide the actual product information for "비안 겨울 스포츠 터치 스키장갑" (Vian Winter Sports Touch Ski Gloves)? I need:

The thumbnail image URL or description
The product purchase link
The detailed product description

Once you provide these details, I'll immediately generate the complete JSON script following all the specifications in your document.
